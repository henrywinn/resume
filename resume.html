                            Rivs is a startup that builds software to make the hiring process more efficient. Their platform, built on top of a custom PHP framework, allows recruiters to set up live and automated interview processes that contain video, voice, and text responses, as well as other modules like background checks.

                                <li>Heavily involved in project planning and product vision by participating in planning and feature meetings</li>

                                    Brought features to market, from the initial stages of brainstorming and project planning, through to developing, testing and deploying code. Features include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A dashboard framework that displays graphical and textual information to users and allows developers to quickly and easily deploy new 'widgets' to production. This dashboard is at the center of the Rivs platform, and greets the user when they log in.</li>
                                        <li>A graphical interface that allows users to brand their own theme. Branding was traditionally done manually by a developer - offloading this work to the user frees up valuable time for our small team of developers</li>
                                        <li>An interview module that allows recruiters to request references from candidates during the interview</li>
