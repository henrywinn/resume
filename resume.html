                            RIVS develops software for conducting interviews. As one of two lead engineers at the company, my work has always spanned the whole stack and interested every stakeholder in the company.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Worked closely with sales team and the product manager to develop and bring a patented software product to market that has, in more than one case, been the differentiating feature that won us the contract.</li>
                                <li>Completely refactored one of the most valuable products in our suite to address performance bottlenecks as we scale, and to allow our team to more easily debug and develop features for it in the future.</li>
                                <li>Participated in calls with clients to help identify pain points and develop action plans to address those.</li>
                                <li>Helped train new hires in our development procedures, guided them towards the solutions to questions asked, and made them feel welcome in our small team.</li>
                                <li>Identified issues and provided constructive feedback and suggestions in pull requests.</li>
                                <li>Always added descriptive commit messages and documentation.</li>
                                <li>Prepared for and attended daily scrum meetings, weekly costing meetings, and bi-weekly sprint retrospectives.</li>
                                <li>Been on call and have responded to infrastructure alerts from AWS CloudWatch.</li>
                                <li>Assured quality through rigorous unit testing and pull requested changes.</li>
                                <li>
                                    I have had the pleasure of working with a number of technologies during my time at RIVS:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>PHP, Javascript, MySQL, HTML, and CSS - The technologies I'm most likely to be working with on a given day.</li>
                                        <li>Ruckusing - A database migration tool (supposedly similar to Active Records in Ruby on Rails, although I've never used that myself).</li>
                                        <li>AWS products including Lambda, Cloud Formation Templates, and, of course, EC2 and S3.</li>
                                        <li>NodeJS - A few smaller parts of our product use NodeJS for RTC. Also have used it for use on AWS Lambda.</li>
                                        <li>Angular.js, C#, .NET - One of our products is built on these technologies and I've had the opportunity to dip my toes into it's development.</li>
                                        <li>Smarty - A templating engine for PHP.</li>
                                    </ul>
